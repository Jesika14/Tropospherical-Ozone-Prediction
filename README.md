# Tropospheric Ozone Prediction

This repository contains code and data for predicting ground-level tropospheric ozone (O₃) concentrations using machine learning techniques. The aim is to model the relationship between meteorological parameters, precursor gases, and ozone formation using supervised learning methods.

## Project Overview

- Developed machine learning models (Random Forest Regressor, XGBoost) to predict ozone concentrations.
- Achieved an R² score of 0.80 after hyperparameter tuning and feature engineering.
- Used SHAP and Gini Importance to explain feature contributions and improve interpretability.
- Converted NetCDF meteorological datasets to CSV using `xarray` for preprocessing.

## Files in This Repository

- `Source Link.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook containing the full workflow: preprocessing, modeling, evaluation.
- `Netcdf to csv.py` - Python script to convert `.nc` (NetCDF) files into `.csv` using `xarray`.
- `Final Data Set.csv` - Final dataset after preprocessing, used for model training and testing.
